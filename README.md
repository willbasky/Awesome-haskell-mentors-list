## To experienced Haskell developers

Some developers have an open projects and

- look for a team to develop,
- or have many tasks and not enough hands,
- or suppose "one head is good, but two are better",
- or will to share their knowledge,
- or consider Haskell a worthy language for others.

Why not become a mentor for beginners? Feel free to PR!

## To (not only) beginner Haskell developers

Some developers learn Haskell and feel:

- the basics of the language are mastered,
- the tasks for CodeWars do not benefit the world,
- the ivory tower has grown too much.

Real development is not so unassailable, it helps people. That is important! Why not become a contributor of open source project?
